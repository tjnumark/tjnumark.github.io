Electroencephalography (EEG) is more likely to respond to emotional changes compared to facial expressions and voice because it is not subject to external interference and is not easily disguised. By classifying the emotions of EEG signals, it can provide an aid for future treatment of depression, epilepsy and other diseases. Therefore, this article uses the publicly available EEG emotion dataset and uses a ratio of 80%â€“20% to divide the training set and test set. The features of EEG data are extracted using Fast fourier transform (FFT), and the Convolutional neural network (CNN) in deep learning is used as the basic premise to incorporate the channel attention mechanism. An EEG emotion recognition model combining CNN and channel attention mechanism is designed, which includes three convolutional layers, three channel attention blocks, three maximum pooling layers, three fully connected layers, a dense layer and a softmax layer, and batch normalization is used to suppress the overfitting of the model. Experimental results show that the sentiment recognition accuracy of the DEAP dataset reaches 90%, which achieves a significant improvement over existing emotion recognition models.
